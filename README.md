# PJ-Flights

An SPA decoupled website application that has two basic interfaces: one that allows you to enter plane flights into an admin panel, and another that allows you to search for flights.

## PJAngular (Front-End)
Developed using:
- Angular framework
- Typescript programming language
- SCSS stylesheets

## PJNest (Back-End)

- TypeORM for communicating with the database
- PostgreSQL for RDBMS

## To host locally:

- Have the npm or yarn CLI package managers downloaded
- run `npm install` or `yarn upgrade` in the PJAngular and the PJNest directories to restore the modules
- run `npm run start` or `yarn run` within each directory mentioned above
