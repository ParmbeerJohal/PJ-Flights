# PJ-Flights

An SPA decoupled website application that has two basic interfaces: one that allows you to enter plane flights into an admin panel, and another that allows you to search for flights.

## PJAngular (Front-End)
Developed using:
- Angular framework
- Typescript programming language
- SCSS stylesheets

## PJNest (Back-End)
Developed using:
- NestJS framework with REST API functionality
- TypeORM for communicating with the database
- PostgreSQL for RDBMS

## PostgreSQL (Database)
- This application works with a locally hosted PostreSQL RDBMS

## To host locally:
- Simply clone the repository
- Have the npm CLI package manager downloaded
- run `npm install` in the PJAngular and the PJNest directories to restore the modules
- run `npm run start` within each directory mentioned above
- Open up your browser and type in the url `localhost:4200`
